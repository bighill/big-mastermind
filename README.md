# Big Mastermind

A webapp version of the board game mastermind.

## Requirements

[node](https://nodejs.dev) && [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org)

```bash
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

## Usage

```bash
# Development: hot reloading, linting, error checking, etc
npm run dev

# Production build (builds to /public)
npm run build

# Serve production build locally
npm run serve

# See package.json for all options
```

When running locally in dev mode, you can add the query string `cheat` to display the answer; e.g. `http://localhost:8000/?cheat`.

## Why

The main reason for making this was to test GatsbyJS. Gatsby would shine much better when used for a blog or information-heavy site because of the cool routing features, but I got hung up on reproducing a game from my childhood, so here we are.
